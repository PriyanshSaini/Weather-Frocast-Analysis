# Weather-Ffrocast-Analysis

Conducted an in-depth analysis of weather data using Pandas and Power BI to extract insights on weather patterns and key metrics such as temperature, wind speed, and visibility.

**Key Contributions:**

**Pandas Analysis:**

Explored data structure and attributes using functions like .head(), .shape, .info(), and .dtypes.
Performed queries to identify specific weather conditions, such as instances of clear weather, snowfall, or high wind speeds.
Handled missing values, renamed columns, and calculated statistical metrics like mean, standard deviation, and variance.
Filtered data to identify conditions like wind speed above 24 mph with clear weather or visibility greater than 50 units.

**Power BI Visualizations:**

Created monthly trends of average temperature, dew point, visibility, humidity, and wind speed.
Developed interactive dashboards to track weather metrics and highlight significant patterns.
Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas): Data exploration, cleaning, and statistical analysis.
Power BI: Visualization of weather trends and summary metrics.
Impact:

Provided actionable insights into weather patterns for forecasting and decision-making.
Delivered dynamic dashboards to monitor and communicate key weather metrics effectively.
This project showcases expertise in Python for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, emphasizing statistical evaluation and trend analysis.


**Project Target Questions:**  

1. **Pandas Analysis Targets:**  
   - How many times was the weather recorded as "Clear"?  
   - During what instances did the wind speed exceed 25 mph?  
   - Are there any null values in the dataset, and how are they distributed?  
   - What is the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the temperature?  
   - How many instances of snowfall were recorded?  
   - What conditions occurred when the wind speed was above 24 mph and the weather was clear?  
   - What are the maximum and minimum values for each weather condition?  
   - How often was the visibility greater than 50 or the weather clear?  

2. **Power BI Analysis Targets:**  
   - What are the monthly trends for average temperature and dew point?  
   - What is the average monthly visibility across the dataset?  
   - How does the average monthly humidity vary over time?  
   - What are the patterns in average wind speed per month?  

These questions serve as a guide to explore weather data, derive meaningful insights, and provide actionable visualizations.

**Outcomes:**  

1. **Key Weather Insights:**  
   - Identified patterns of clear weather, snowfall, and high wind speed instances for better understanding of weather trends.  
   - Highlighted days with exceptional conditions, such as visibility over 50 or wind speeds above 24 mph, to study their impact.  

2. **Statistical Analysis Results:**  
   - Calculated essential metrics like mean, standard deviation, and variance for temperature and other weather parameters, aiding in variability analysis.  
   - Detected and addressed missing values to ensure data integrity for accurate analysis.  

3. **Monthly Weather Trends:**  
   - Revealed seasonal variations in temperature, dew point, visibility, humidity, and wind speed through Power BI dashboards.  
   - Provided clear visualizations of average monthly weather metrics to support forecasting and reporting.  

4. **Data Presentation and Accessibility:**  
   - Created interactive Power BI dashboards for stakeholders, simplifying the communication of complex weather trends.  
   - Enabled data-driven decision-making by presenting actionable insights from the dataset.  

These outcomes demonstrate expertise in data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization, while providing valuable insights into weather trends.
